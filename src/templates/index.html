		speaker: 'Leonardo Garcia Crespo',
		desc: 'TweetDeck is complex application with a massive codebase that’s been around for more than 10 years. It started as an Adobe Air app, but the current codebase really started as a Chrome Web Store app. It once powered a windows app, and now it is a single page app that is accessed in a browser but also as a Mac app. It went through countless refactors, tech stacks, feature additions, removals and modifications, and lots of bugfixes and workarounds for now old browsers. As such, it accumulated technical debt and a lot of different coding paradigms. However, we managed to introduce React and successfully migrate several parts of the application, which allowed us to start moving faster again in those places. In this talk I want to show how we did that, some techniques and problems to solve when migrating an old codebase into React, and also learn to love what React gives us by looking at the problems we had before and how React removes them.'

		disconnected: true,
		time: 'TBD',
		title: 'Moving intensive logic Elsewhere.',

Let’s explore some examples where that might be the case, and some strategies where React’s new(ish) Hooks API can help you escape from React and interface with non-React parts of your codebase.'

		time: 'TBD',
		title: 'Build your own Native Module',
		speaker: 'Patrick Loureiro',
		desc: 'Sometimes an app needs to access a platform API and React Native doesn’t have a corresponding module yet. Maybe you want to reuse some existing Objective-C, Swift or C++ code without having to reimplement it in JavaScript, or write some high performance, multi-threaded code such as for image processing, a database, or any number of advanced extensions. In this talk you will learn how to do that and see a real-world example.'
	},{

		speaker: 'Lorenzo Sciandra',
		desc: 'React Native is now 4 years old. During this time, we’ve observed more progression than ever before towards the vision of a cross-platform mobile solution. Even still, we have yet to realise its core mission of being as powerful as pure native. There have been many challenges that we’ve faced head on as they’ve surfaced. In overcoming them with the support of the community, we’ve managed to establish React Native as a force that is now defining the future of the segment.<br/>
		In this talk, we’ll explore this history-in-the-making before diving deeper into more technical subjects including the JSI & JSC upgrade, TurboModules & Fabric, and the CodeGen. With all the pieces of the puzzle in place and landing on master by end of the year, we are closer to reaching our original objective than ever before - while pushing the limits to a whole new level.'

		Let’s take a look what tools browsers offer today. You can build beautiful and accessible experiences while supporting mobile devices and not sacrificing the performance! This talk is inspired by the recently released react-movable library.'

When done successfully, it suddenly becomes trivial to translate standard designs into code. In fact, we may even find that this translation step starts to feel somewhat redundant. In a world of components, how should our design processes change? How should our tooling change? How should we, as React developers, better enable this change? In this talk, we&apos;ll look at the current state of design and developersment, and where we could go—if we&apos;re willing to push for it.</p>'
