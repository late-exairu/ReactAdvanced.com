It started as an Adobe Air app, but the current codebase really started as a Chrome Web Store app. It once powered a windows app, and now it is a single page app that is accessed in a browser but also as a Mac app. It went through countless refactors, tech stacks, feature additions, removals and modifications, and lots of bugfixes and workarounds for now old browsers. As such, it accumulated technical debt and a lot of different coding paradigms. However, we managed to introduce React and successfully migrate several parts of the application, which allowed us to start moving faster again in those places. In this talk I want to show how we did that, some techniques and problems to solve when migrating an old codebase into React, and also learn to love what React gives us by looking at the problems we had before and how React removes them.'

In overcoming them with the support of the community, we’ve managed to establish React Native as a force that is now defining the future of the segment.<br/>

After all, they’re both all about being in charge - who gets to render, who gets to update, who gets to decide how things should look... the story goes on and on. But with these two, as in life, the best relationship is about compromise and sharing responsibilities. So, how can we turn a tug-of-war into a beautiful, responsive, animated tango? Enter, React hooks!'

		desc: '<p class="schedule-list__p">Thanks to React&apos;s component-oriented architecture, the React community has been naturally gravitating towards design systems as a way of standardising our respective design languages into reusable components. When done successfully, it suddenly becomes trivial to translate standard designs into code. In fact, we may even find that this translation step starts to feel somewhat redundant. In a world of components, how should our design processes change? How should our tooling change? How should we, as React developers, better enable this change? In this talk, we&apos;ll look at the current state of design and developersment, and where we could go—if we&apos;re willing to push for it.</p>'
